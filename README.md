This repository contains the extended encoding function acceleration of Classic McEliece Key Encapsulation Mechanism (CM KEM). It is based on the 4rth Round submission of the CM KEM to the NIST Post-Quantum Standardization contest. 
The accelerator's HLS source code is located at the "mceliece{LEVEL}/kernel/" branches. The different directories "mceliece{LEVEL}" are hardware implementations for the different security levels implemented in CM KEM.
